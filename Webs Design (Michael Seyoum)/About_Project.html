            1.When I faced problems while making my website I went to  w3schools  to and look at different solutions and fixes. I also looked back at other codes that Mr. Drenth made in class. I had difficulty in placing boxes in specific areas so I researched using w3schools on how to place text boxes and discovered relative positions which I used for each photo and box. I did not understand how the grid worked so I looked at w3schools and it helped me understand what each line of code means. Another problem I faced was that when I tried to copy content pages the place of the text boxes and images would not stay in the same place. I had to re-type relative positions for most of my different pages.<br>

            <br>
            2.I had difficulty deciding on what to do and once I decided what to do, I did not know how I was planning to design the website. I planned for the website to have products from at least Nintendo, Xbox, and PayStation. Afterwards, I had to make up my mind on how to design the website itself. I looked at different websites like Best Buy, Walmart and Eb games for inspiration. Once I had my designs planned I had to research content for my website. I looked at different video game stores like Best Buy for descriptions of websites and prices. Once I had all of my information gathered I created my website and imputed photos and text. It took me a very long time to research all the descriptions and find photos.<br>

            3.Parents would want to visit my website for purchasing games and consoles for their kids, and gamers will want to visit my website for accessories and new consoles. I would give my website a level 4 out of five because it has too much spacing and lacks enough text in some places. I could do better on my website if I had more time but considering all of the content I was able to implement I am happy with my website.<br>
